"Eco Scan" is a pioneering project leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and image processing techniques for rapid and accurate plant disease detection. Using high-resolution images of plants, the system employs advanced CNN algorithms to analyze and identify potential diseases swiftly. The project's primary objective is to provide a user-friendly interface for farmers, allowing them to upload crop images and receive real-time analyses, enabling early disease detection and informed decision-making. By integrating state-of-the-art technology into agriculture, Eco Scan aims to optimize crop health monitoring, minimize losses, and promote sustainable farming practices.
